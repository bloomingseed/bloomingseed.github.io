## Tasks planning for v1.0-alpha

- Reformat the form



## TODO

- somehow the conditional formatting rules are not being applied

- test 3 q 6, https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%A9a
- confirm that test 1 question 1 actually counts (since it's not in the survey)

- allow respondee to know his/her score
- save temporary response of each test after clicking next
- add a take rest, get ready page before each test
    - add a 0.5 step after step 0. nextStep now increases the step by 0.5 each, and there will be rest screen at those fractional step counts.
- rest screen between each test
- screen recording?




- add confirmation before submission

- ability to config questions from javascript or config file and load it up without touching the html (the html is then generated from js instead)
- only allow 1 audio to be played at a time (use singleton pattern for existing audio player and its isPlaying state)

- use github build automation to inject POST_URL
- Add red border to invalid inputs
