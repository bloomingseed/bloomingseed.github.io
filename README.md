## bloomingseed.github.io
- A portfolio page where I put self description and products I created/contributed.

## TODO

- add confirmation before submission
- check why the audio sometimes fails to be played

- reduce all question components into a single one.
- ability to config questions from javascript or config file and load it up without touching the html (the html is then generated from js instead)
- only allow 1 audio to be played at a time (use singleton pattern for existing audio player and its isPlaying state)

- use github build automation to inject POST_URL
- Add red border to invalid inputs

- detect existing data in the session even if haven't submitted so we can track the timer more accurately? -- maybe not, since the users are expected to finish in one go.

## Portfolio TODO

- Write up my education
